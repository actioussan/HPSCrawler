/**
  * GenCrawler is a library for your crawling needs. It is designed to be very modular and easily expandable.
  *
  * A crawling process can be described by using multiple so called Interpreters. A Interpreter takes a variable,
  * does some work and then return another variable. These Interpreter inputs can be dependant on others to create
  * a tree like dependencies.
  *
  * The class GenCrawler located in the core package provides an easy way to handle such interpreters and therefor
  * should be used as primarily for your crawling needs.
